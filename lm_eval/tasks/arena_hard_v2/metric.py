"""Arena-Hard v2.0 metric for lm-evaluation-harness.

Implements pairwise judge evaluation using Qwen3.5—27B as judge,
served via the CSCS SwissAI API.

The evaluation follows the Arena-Hard protocol:
  1. Model outputs are compared pairwise against o3-mini-2025-01-31 baseline responses.
  2. A judge LLM evaluates which response is better and outputs a verdict
     in the format [[A>>B]], [[A>B]], [[A=B]], [[B>A]], or [[B>>A]].
  3. Two rounds are performed per question with positions swapped to mitigate
     position bias.
  4. Strong preferences (>> or <<) receive 3x weight in scoring.
  5. Win rate is computed via bootstrap resampling (100 rounds) with 90% CI.
